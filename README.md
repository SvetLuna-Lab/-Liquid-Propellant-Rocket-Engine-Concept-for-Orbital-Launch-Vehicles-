# Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engine Concept for Orbital Launch Vehicles  
**Author:** Svetlana Romanova  
**Year:** 2025  

## Overview  
This repository presents a conceptual model of a liquid-propellant rocket engine (LPRE) designed for orbital launch vehicles. The model covers key design parameters such as combustion chamber pressure, nozzle expansion ratio, and thrust-to-weight (T/W) optimization.

## Key Specifications  
- Combustion chamber pressure (Pc): 20 MPa  
- Nozzle expansion ratio (Ae/At): ~30 for first stage, ~60 for upper stage  
- Thrust-to-weight ratio (T/W): ~80 N/kg  
- Propellant combination: LOX + RP-1 (first stage) or LOX + LH₂ (upper stage)

## Repository Structure  
See folder structure above for how material is organised.

## Getting Started  
1. Read through `docs/overview.md` for background and objectives.  
2. View `docs/specification.md` for detailed engine specs.  
3. Run sizing/optimization scripts in `calculations/` (requires Python, etc.).  
4. Review `figures/` for diagrams and trade-off tables.

## Next Steps  
- Detailed thermodynamic & cycle analysis via NASA CEA and CFD coupling.  
- Material & manufacturing trade-studies.  
- Prototype and test plan definition.
