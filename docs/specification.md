# Engine Specifications  
This document summarizes the baseline parameters of the conceptual engine.

| Parameter                        | Value                     | Notes                                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Chamber Pressure, Pc             | 20 MPa                    | Balanced performance vs mass              |
| Nozzle Expansion Ratio (Ae/At)   | ~30 (first stage)         | Moderate expansion in atmosphere           |
|                                  | ~60 (upper stage)         | Optimized for vacuum                       |
| Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (T/W)     | ~80 N/kg                  | Target for high performance                |
| Propellant                       | LOX + RP-1 (stage 1)      | Dense propellant, good performance         |
|                                  | LOX + LH₂ (upper stage)   | High Isp, complex storage                  |

## Notes  
- Higher Pc improves specific impulse and efficiency but demands advanced materials and cooling systems.  
- Expansion ratio depends on ambient pressure: higher in vacuum gives better exhaust expansion and Isp.  
- T/W optimisation achieved via lightweight materials, compact turbo-pump systems, and efficient plumbing.
