# Overview  
This project presents a conceptual design of a liquid-propellant rocket engine for orbital launch vehicles. It outlines the key engine parameters—combustion chamber pressure, nozzle expansion ratio, thrust-to-weight optimisation—and covers material & propellant choice (LOX/RP-1 and LOX/LH₂), engine cycle considerations and computational workflows for sizing and trade-off analysis.
