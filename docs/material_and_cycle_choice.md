# Material & Cycle Choice  
## Material Selection  
### Aluminum-Lithium Alloys (Al-Li)  
- High strength at cryogenic temperatures and relatively lightweight.  
- Widely used in cryogenic tanks and engine structures.  
- Proven manufacturing processes (FSW, orthogrid).  
- Strong technological maturity.

### Composite Materials (CFRP + Metallic Liner)  
- Potential mass savings (~15-30%) vs Al-Li for matched structural load.  
- Require internal liners (Al, Ti) for hermeticity and hydrogen permeation control.  
- Lower technology readiness for large cryogenic engine structures; higher NDI/qualification cost.

### Trade-Off Summary  
| Criterion                      | Al-Li (baseline)     | CFRP + metallic liner          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Relative mass                  | 1.0 (baseline)       | ~0.70-0.85×                   |
| Technological maturity         | High                 | Medium/Low (especially LH₂)    |
| Hermeticity / H₂ permeation    | Reliable             | Higher risk                    |
| Production & qualification cost| Moderate             | Higher                         |

## Propulsion Cycle Considerations  
- Simpler cycles (gas-generator, staged‐combustion) are proven and easier to manufacture.  
- For high performance upper stage: more advanced cycles (expander, full-flow, staged-combustion) may be justified.  
- Cycle choice impacts engine mass, complexity, reliability and cost.

## Baseline Recommendation  
For the conceptual engine:  
- Use Al-Li alloy structure (high TRL) to manage risk and cost.  
- Choose LOX+RP-1 first stage cycle (e.g., gas-generator) and LOX+LH₂ upper stage cycle (e.g., staged-combustion).  
- Adopt cycle/material trade-off studies as part of computational workflow.
