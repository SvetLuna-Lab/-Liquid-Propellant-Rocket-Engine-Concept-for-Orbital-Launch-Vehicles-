# Thrust-to-Weight (T/W) Optimisation  
## Definition  
T/W = Thrust / (Engine mass × g₀) — a key performance metric. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

## Target Value  
A target T/W of ~80 N/kg is selected as a feasible compromise between performance and manufacturability for an orbital engine.

## Influencing Factors  
- Engine mass: use high-strength lightweight alloys/titanium, compact turbo-pumps.  
- Thrust: determined by mass flow, chamber pressure, expansion ratio.  
- Material and cycle choice: advanced cycles give higher Isp but may increase complexity and engine mass.

## Benchmarks  
Example: RD‑170 achieved T/W ≈ 82. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
