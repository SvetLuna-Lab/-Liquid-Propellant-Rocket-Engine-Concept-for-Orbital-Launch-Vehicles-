# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge  
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of **Liquid-Propellant-Rocket-Engine-Concept-for-Orbital-Launch-Vehicles** pledge to make participation in our community open, inclusive, and harassment-free, for everyone — regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards  
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:  
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.  
- Giving and graciously accepting constructive feedback.  
- Focusing on what is best for the community as a whole.  

Examples of behavior that will **not** be tolerated include:  
- Violence, threats or harassment in any form.  
- Publishing others’ private information (doxing) without permission.  
- Discriminatory language and imagery or exclusionary jokes.  
- Disruption of the normal flow of discussion or contribution process.  

## Scope  
This Code of Conduct applies both within project-spaces and in public when an individual is representing the project — **Liquid-Propellant-Rocket-Engine-Concept-for-Orbital-Launch-Vehicles** (e.g., code repositories, issue trackers, forums, mailing lists, social media) and extends to offline events when applicable.

## Enforcement  
Maintainers of the project are responsible for deciding whether a reported behavior is in violation of this Code of Conduct. Once a report is received, it will be reviewed and the reporter may remain anonymous if desired. The appropriate action will be taken depending on severity — from a warning to expulsion from the community.  

## Reporting  
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to: svetlana.ivan.romanova@gmail.com  
Requests to maintain anonymity will be respected. All reports will be treated in confidence and investigated promptly.
